            <h2>About our Church</h2>
            <p>Mooers Wesleyan Church was established in 1872.  Fifty five years later, the buildings
                were destroyed by fire, but the congregation’s spirit was not.  The present day sancturay and
                parsonage are products of the rebuilding which took place following the devastation.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>In 1966, the small congregation understood it’s need of a place for activities and a
                fellowship hall was added to accomodate about 60 people.  It was used for various
                church socials and included a tiny kitchen, two small bathrooms, with additional classrooms
                downstairs. In 1998 the church took on further renovations reversing the sanctuary,
                which added a much larger platform, and a more family friendly accesible area for children.
                Just recently additional property next to the church was purchased which  now serves as
                a vibrant growing youth center, with men and women’s Bible studies as well.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>The Local Board of Mooers Wesleyan Church is now planning future renovations.  We feel
                we are a growing a church and want God to continue to grow His family here. </p>

                As a couple they have taken on spiritual and renovation challenges with a desire to see the church grow into a place where both American and Canadian 
                families can come to worship.  Living Hope is a radio program that Pastor John has done on WCHP for several years ministering to New York, Vermont,

                As Senior pastor he challenges the church family to a higher and deeper standard in Jesus, and in that desire has been a leader in establishing a local food shelf, 
                a team that ministers to the homeless monthly in Montreal, and there are misisons that outreach to children through  Samaritans Purse. </p>
