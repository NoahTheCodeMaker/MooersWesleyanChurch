      <h2>Home</h2>
      <p>Welcome to Mooers Wesleyan Church where our Pastor is John Gillette.  Mooers Wesleyan is a church with a vision to reach our community with 
        the gospel of Jesus Christ.  Please come join us on Sunday morning for Bible teaching with interactive Bible classes for children and a fully 
        staffed nursery.  Teens will enjoy classes structured for their needs.  We offer in depth classes specifically for adult women and men as well.</p>
      <p>During our church services there is time for children again to receive teaching.  Mooers Wesleyan has taken on a community vision with outreaches 
        to help feed the needy in both Mooers and Montreal and to reach out to other countries in the form of a “shoe box” ministry.  There is also midweek 
        services with teaching and fellowship for all ages including an exciting youth program.  Please come join us as we apply the teachings of Jesus Christ to our lives.</p>
